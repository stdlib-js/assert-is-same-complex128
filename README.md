    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

# isSameComplex128

[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][test-image]][test-url] [![Coverage Status][coverage-image]][coverage-url] <!-- [![dependencies][dependencies-image]][dependencies-url] -->

> Test if two arguments are both [double-precision complex floating-point numbers][@stdlib/complex/float64/ctor] and have the [same value][@stdlib/assert/is-same-value].



<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
import isSameComplex128 from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/assert-is-same-complex128@deno/mod.js';
```

#### isSameComplex128( v1, v2 )

Tests if two arguments are both [double-precision complex floating-point numbers][@stdlib/complex/float64/ctor] and have the [same value][@stdlib/assert/is-same-value].

```javascript
import Complex128 from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/complex-float64-ctor@deno/mod.js';

var x = new Complex128( 1.0, 2.0 );
var y = new Complex128( 1.0, 2.0 );
var bool = isSameComplex128( x, y );
// returns true
```

</section>

<!-- /.usage -->

<section class="notes">

## Notes

-   In contrast to the strict equality operator `===`, the function distinguishes between `+0` and `-0` and treats `NaNs` as the [same value][@stdlib/assert/is-same-value].

</section>

<!-- /.notes -->

<section class="examples">

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
import Complex128 from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/complex-float64-ctor@deno/mod.js';
import isSameComplex128 from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/assert-is-same-complex128@deno/mod.js';

var x = new Complex128( 1.0, 2.0 );
var y = new Complex128( 1.0, 2.0 );
var out = isSameComplex128( x, y );
// returns true

x = new Complex128( 0.0, -0.0 );
y = new Complex128( -0.0, 0.0 );
out = isSameComplex128( x, y );
// returns false

x = new Complex128( NaN, NaN );
y = new Complex128( NaN, NaN );
out = isSameComplex128( x, y );
// returns true
```
